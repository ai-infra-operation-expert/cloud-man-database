## 1. Anchor Pages — Top 10 Hubs

The most-referenced pages in the vault, ranked by incoming wikilink count.

| # | Page | In | Out | Type | Cluster |
|---|------|---:|----:|------|---------|
| 1 | [[Evaluation_Workflow]] | 88 | 5 | sink hub | 15_Agent_Production |
| 2 | [[概念/General/ai-stack]] | 83 | 50 | connector hub | 12_Architecture_Infrastructure |
| 3 | [[kubernetes]] | 81 | 17 | connector hub | 概念 |
| 4 | [[15_智能体/07_Agent评估/08_Agent_红队测试_2026]] | 76 | 5 | sink hub | 15_Agent_Production |
| 5 | [[概念/Agent/agent-harness]] | 76 | 4 | sink hub | 15_Agent_Production |
| 6 | [[15_智能体/07_Agent评估/Assessment/01_生产_Assessment]] | 72 | 5 | sink hub | 15_Agent_Production |
| 7 | [[10_部署推理/02_推理引擎/29_vLLM_深入分析]] | 66 | 10 | balanced hub | 10_Deployment_Inference |
| 8 | [[90_学习/04_实践指南/02_AI工程路线图2026]] | 50 | 73 | connector hub | 90_Learn |
| 9 | [[kv-cache]] | 49 | 9 | balanced hub | 概念 |
| 10 | [[ai-agents]] | 45 | 9 | balanced hub | 概念 |

**Key observations:**
- The **15_Agent_Production** cluster dominates with 4 of the top 6 anchors — agent evaluation is clearly the wiki's gravitational center.
- **AI_Stack_Deep_Dive** and **ai_engineering_roadmap_2026** are the primary *connector hubs* (high outgoing counts of 50 and 73 respectively), actively bridging many other topics.
- 6 of 10 top anchors are *sink hubs* (high in, low out) — they accumulate references but don't distribute them. Consider adding more outgoing links from these pages to strengthen graph connectivity.
- The **概念** directory holds 3 of the top 10 anchors, confirming its role as a shared vocabulary layer.

## 2. Bridge Pages — Top 5 Cross-Cluster Connectors

Pages that sit between different topic clusters, linking pages with dissimilar tag profiles.

| # | Page | Bridge Score | Linker Clusters | Linkee Clusters |
|---|------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 1 | [[90_学习/04_实践指南/02_AI工程路线图2026]] | 38.8 | AI_Intro, Fundamentals, ML, NLP, Coding, Apps, Talks, Papers, Learn, concepts, references | Fundamentals, ML, DL, CV, NLP, RL, Eval, Deploy, MLOps, Infra, RAG, Agents, Coding, Ethics, Apps, Talks, Papers, Learn, concepts, references |
| 2 | [[概念/LLM/llm-architectures]] | 35.3 | AI_Intro, Fundamentals, DL, NLP, Eval, Deploy, Papers, Learn, concepts, synthesis | *(no outgoing — pure sink)* |
| 3 | [[90_学习/03_课程资源/microsoft/03_microsoft_ai_agents_for_beginners]] | 35.2 | Agent_Production, Learn, references | Fundamentals, CV, NLP, Deploy, MLOps, Infra, AI_Ops, RAG, Agents, Ethics, Learn, concepts, references |
| 4 | [[10_部署推理/02_推理引擎/29_vLLM_深入分析]] | 31.3 | DL, NLP, Training, Eval, Deploy, MLOps, Infra, RAG, concepts, synthesis | Deploy, Infra, synthesis |
| 5 | [[概念/General/ai-stack]] | 30.1 | Infra, concepts, synthesis | NLP, Deploy, Infra, RAG, concepts |

**Key observations:**
- **ai_engineering_roadmap_2026** bridges 11 different directory clusters, making it the most structurally important page in the entire wiki. It is both a learning roadmap and a navigation backbone.
- **LLM_Architectures** has a high bridge score but 0 outgoing links — it is referenced from 10 different clusters but points nowhere. This is a missed connectivity opportunity.
- **microsoft_ai_agents_for_beginners** uniquely bridges the Agent Production cluster with CV, MLOps, AI_Ops, and Ethics — a rare interdisciplinary link.

## 3. Tag Cluster Cohesion

How tightly interconnected are pages sharing the same tag? Cohesion = actual links / possible links.

### Top 5 Most Cohesive Tags

| Tag | Pages | Actual Links | Max Possible | Cohesion |
|-----|------:|-------------:|-------------:|---------:|
| vgpu | 5 | 10 | 10 | 1.0000 |
| - ai | 25 | 262 | 300 | 0.8733 |
| gpu-virtualization | 7 | 17 | 21 | 0.8095 |
| remote-support | 5 | 8 | 10 | 0.8000 |
| assessment | 5 | 8 | 10 | 0.8000 |

### Top 5 Most Fragmented Tags (largest groups with zero cohesion)

| Tag | Pages | Actual Links | Max Possible | Cohesion |
|-----|------:|-------------:|-------------:|---------:|
| prompt-injection | 7 | 0 | 21 | 0.0000 |
| llm-security | 5 | 0 | 10 | 0.0000 |
| best-practices | 5 | 0 | 10 | 0.0000 |
| overview | 5 | 0 | 10 | 0.0000 |
| model-selection | 5 | 0 | 10 | 0.0000 |

**Key observations:**
- **364 tags** have 5+ pages and were evaluated for cohesion.
- The most cohesive clusters are infrastructure-specific (vgpu, gpu-virtualization) — tight technical domains with strong internal cross-referencing.
- Security-related tags (**prompt-injection**, **llm-security**) are notably fragmented: 7+ pages share the tag but have zero wikilinks between them. This suggests the security knowledge is scattered and would benefit from a synthesis page or cross-links.
- Generic tags (**overview**, **best-practices**, **model-selection**) have zero cohesion — these may be overly broad or inconsistently applied.

## 4. Surprising Connections — Top 5 Unexpected Links

Cross-category wikilinks that bridge distant knowledge areas.

| # | Source | Target | Score | Reasons |
|---|--------|--------|------:|---------|
| 1 | [[90_学习/03_课程资源/other/06_fastai_practical_dl]] | [[00_入门/03_学习路径/02_AI学习资源]] | 5 | Cross-category (90_Learn -> 00_AI_Introduction); isolated source (2 links) connecting to popular target (16 links) |
| 2 | [[90_学习/05_参考资料/books/10_designing_ml_systems_huyen]] | [[90_学习/04_实践指南/02_AI工程路线图2026]] | 5 | Cross-category (参考 -> 90_Learn); isolated source (2 links) connecting to popular target (123 links) |
| 3 | [[11_模型运维/14_云运维Agent/docs/02_agentscope_corpus_loading]] | [[13_运维/04_问题排查/05_diagnosis_work_order_hub]] | 5 | Cross-category (项目 -> 综合); isolated source (2 links) connecting to popular target (18 links) |
| 4 | [[RAG_Debugging_Cheat_Sheet]] | [[vector-database]] | 5 | Cross-category (14_RAG_Systems -> 概念); isolated source (2 links) connecting to popular target (27 links) |
| 5 | [[90_学习/05_参考资料/books/03_nlp_with_transformers]] | [[90_学习/04_实践指南/02_AI工程路线图2026]] | 5 | Cross-category (参考 -> 90_Learn); isolated source (2 links) connecting to popular target (123 links) |

**Key observations:**
- The **参考** (book/course summaries) -> **90_Learn** (roadmaps) pattern appears twice, suggesting that learning resources are a natural bridge between reference material and structured curricula.
- **agentscope_corpus_loading** -> **diagnosis-work-order-hub** is a unique project-to-synthesis bridge — a practical debugging workflow linked from a project context.
- 38% of all links are cross-directory, indicating good structural integration across the wiki. The most active cross-directory corridors are: Architecture <-> concepts (437 links), Deploy <-> concepts (176 links), and NLP <-> Learn (116 links).

## 5. Orphan-Adjacent Suggestions

Pages linked from top-10 hubs but with zero outgoing links — dead ends that receive attention from the most important pages but don't connect further.

| Page | Incoming | Linked From Hub(s) |
|------|---------:|--------------------|
| [[02_机器学习/12_ML框架/03_lightgbm_概览]] | 2 | ai_engineering_roadmap_2026 |
| [[15_智能体/06_记忆基础设施/02_Agent_Memory_技术]] | 2 | ai_engineering_roadmap_2026 |
| [[02_机器学习/12_ML框架/01_catboost_概览]] | 2 | ai_engineering_roadmap_2026 |
| [[02_机器学习/12_ML框架/05_scikit_learn_概览]] | 2 | ai_engineering_roadmap_2026 |
| [[20_论文精读/10_检索技术/02_RAG_深入分析]] | 2 | ai_engineering_roadmap_2026 |
| [[03_深度学习/08_DL框架/05_keras_概览]] | 2 | ai_engineering_roadmap_2026 |
| [[Chain_of_Thought_Deep_Dive]] | 2 | ai_engineering_roadmap_2026 |
| [[AI_Finance_Applications_2026]] | 1 | ai_engineering_roadmap_2026 |
| [[AI_Education_Applications_2026]] | 1 | ai_engineering_roadmap_2026 |

**Recommendation:** All 9 orphan-adjacent pages are linked from **ai_engineering_roadmap_2026** (the primary connector hub) but have no outgoing links. Adding 2-3 outgoing wikilinks from each would strengthen the learning pathway — particularly **Agent_Memory_Techniques** and **Chain_of_Thought_Deep_Dive**, which should link to agent production and NLP clusters respectively.

## 7. Tier Assignment Suggestions

### Promote to Core (296 candidates — showing top 5)

Pages with high incoming links (>=5) currently marked as `supporting` or with no tier field, suggesting they should be elevated to `core`.

| Page | Incoming | Current Tier | Cluster |
|------|---------:|--------------|---------|
| [[90_学习/04_实践指南/02_AI工程路线图2026]] | 50 | supporting | 90_Learn |
| [[ai-agents]] | 45 | supporting | 概念 |
| [[transformer-architecture]] | 41 | supporting | 概念 |
| [[12_架构基建/02_架构概览/02_AI_基础设施_2026]] | 40 | supporting | 12_Architecture_Infrastructure |
| [[90_学习/03_课程资源/microsoft/01_microsoft_genai_for_beginners]] | 36 | supporting | 90_Learn |

### Demote to Peripheral (46 candidates — showing top 5)

Pages with <=1 incoming link, not updated in 90+ days, currently marked as `core` or `supporting` — potentially overstated.

| Page | Incoming | Current Tier | Last Updated | Cluster |
|------|---------:|--------------|-------------|---------|
| [[15_智能体/02_Agent框架/01_agent_framework_production]] | 0 | core | (unknown) | 综合 |
| [[21_面试岗位/18_面试指南/01_career_interviews]] | 0 | core | (unknown) | 综合 |
| [[11_模型运维/14_云运维Agent/docs/02_agentscope_corpus_loading]] | 0 | core | (unknown) | 项目 |
| [[18_行业应用/01_行业概览/04_ai_industry_applications]] | 0 | core | (unknown) | 综合 |
| [[stackops]] | 1 | core | (unknown) | 概念 |

**Note:** Many demote candidates have `(unknown)` dates, suggesting missing `updated:` frontmatter fields. Consider adding timestamps before demoting — the tier may be correct but the metadata incomplete.

## 8. Suggested Questions

Questions the wiki's structure is uniquely positioned to answer — or that reveal gaps in coverage.

1. **"What is the complete path from training a model to serving it in production?"**
   The wiki has strong coverage in both 07_Model_Training and 10_Deployment_Inference, but the bridge pages connecting training to deployment are sparse. Only 71 cross-links exist between these clusters. A synthesis page tracing the full model lifecycle would fill a critical gap.

2. **"How do agent evaluation criteria differ from traditional ML evaluation?"**
   Evaluation_Workflow (88 in) and the 08_Model_Evaluation cluster both anchor heavily referenced content, but there are few explicit links between agent-specific evaluation and traditional ML metrics. A comparison synthesis page would leverage both clusters.

3. **"Which inference engine should I choose for my use case — vLLM, SGLang, or TGI?"**
   vLLM_Deep_Dive (66 in), SGLang_Deep_Dive (31 in), and TGI_Deep_Dive (23 in) are all well-referenced, and LLM_Inference_Engine_Selection_Guide (31 in) exists as a hub. But the fragmented `model-selection` tag (0.0 cohesion) suggests no page actually compares them side-by-side with decision criteria.

4. **"How does RAG integrate with agent architectures?"**
   RAG_Systems (38 in) and Agent_Production are both major clusters, but cross-links between them are limited. The RAG_Debugging_Cheat_Sheet -> vector-database connection is one of the few bridges. A "RAG-powered Agents" synthesis page would connect two of the wiki's largest knowledge areas.

5. **"What security threats apply specifically to production agent systems?"**
   The prompt-injection tag (7 pages, 0.0 cohesion) and llm-security tag (5 pages, 0.0 cohesion) are the most fragmented clusters in the wiki. LLM_Security_Complete_Guide and AI_Safety_RedTeaming exist but don't cross-reference each other. This is the wiki's largest knowledge gap by cohesion analysis.

6. **"How does the OpenRouter/OpenCode ecosystem compare to direct API integration?"**
   16_AI_Coding has 26 anchor pages, mostly in a tightly interconnected OpenRouter sub-cluster. But this cluster has limited links to the broader NLP/LLM and Infrastructure clusters. A comparison page would bridge the coding tool ecosystem with the production infrastructure knowledge.

7. **"What is the relationship between context engineering and prompt engineering?"**
   Context_Engineering_Guide (23 in) is a rising concept, and 73 pages in the vault carry the `^[inferred]` marker linking context engineering to prompt engineering concepts. But no page explicitly maps the evolution from prompt -> context engineering. This is a natural synthesis opportunity.
